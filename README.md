# Dev Docker Image

Making [Funcatron](http://funcatron.org) simple and productive
for developers is key. This means a developer must be able to
write code in their IDE and field Funcatron-routed calls and
debug their code in their IDE.

In order to do that, there are two pieces required:

* A "shim" in the code that will connect to the Funcatron dev image
* A Funcatron  Docker image that contains Funcatron logic

This Docker image provides the latter. It's a basic, stripped down
Funcatron Frontend/Tron/Runner.
